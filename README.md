# Amazon Sales Data Analysis Project

## Overview
Welcome to my Amazon Sales Data Analysis project! In this project, I analyzed a dataset of electronics store purchases from Amazon(USA). I used various Python libraries to clean and analyze the data, uncovering valuable insights into sales patterns, customer behavior, and product correlations.

## Python Libraries Used
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Analysis Steps
1. **Data Cleaning and Formatting:** I started by cleaning the data, handling missing values, and removing duplicates.
2. **Sales Patterns by Month:** I explored the sales patterns by month, revealing that December had the highest sales, possibly due to holiday shopping.
3. **Top-Selling Products:** I identified the top-selling products, with 'AAA Batteries' leading the pack.
4. **Product Pricing Correlation:** I examined the correlation between product pricing and quantity ordered, revealing interesting trends.
5. **Frequently Co-Purchased Products:** I delved into products frequently sold together, offering insights for potential cross-selling strategies.

## Key Insights
- December is the peak sales month, indicating a strong holiday shopping trend.
- The top-selling product is 'AAA Batteries', suggesting its high demand.
- Customers tend to buy cheaper products in larger quantities.
- The analysis provides actionable insights for building a recommendation system based on co-purchased products.
